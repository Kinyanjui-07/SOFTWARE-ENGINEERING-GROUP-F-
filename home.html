					<h4>C++ INTRODUCTION</h4>
					                
					<p> 
						C++ (pronounced “see plus plus”) was developed by Bjarne Stroustrup at Bell Labs as an extension to C, starting in 1979. C++ adds many new features to the C language, and is perhaps best thought of as a superset of C, though this is not strictly true (as C99 introduced a few features that do not exist in C++). C++’s claim to fame results primarily from the fact that it is an object-oriented language. As for what an “object” is and how it differs from traditional programming methods, well, we’ll cover that in later chapters.

						C++ was standardized in 1998 by the ISO committee (this means the ISO standards committee approved a document describing the C++ language, to help ensure all compilers adhere to the same set of standards). A minor update to the language was released in 2003 (called C++03).
						
						Five major updates to the C++ language (C++11, C++14, C++17, C++20, and C++23) have been made since then, each adding additional functionality. C++11 in particular added a huge number of new capabilities, and is widely considered to be the new baseline version of the language. Future upgrades to the language are expected every three or so years.
						
						Each new formal release of the language is called a language standard (or language specification). Standards are named after the year they are released in. For example, there is no C++15, because there was no new standard in 2015.
